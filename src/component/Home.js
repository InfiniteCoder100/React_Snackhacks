                       Food is a commodity that will soon become a luxury for most of us. Not because <br></br>
                        we wonâ€™t be able to afford it, but because food will not be accessible or <br></br>
                        available to the masses. Why, you might ask will this happen? It is because <br></br>
                        the earth too gets exhausted and has an expiry date that may take lifetimes <br></br>
                        to renew. Back in the days of the French revolution, it was the inability of <br></br>
                        people to purchase bread that caused social unrest. In the near future, we may <br></br>
                        not have any food left to fight over. Why? Because we were too caught up with our <br></br>
                        desires of wanting more for now, that we turned a blind eye to the land that <br></br>
                        rotted before us. So Lets get together and stop wasting Food</p>
